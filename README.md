## What is this?
This is a discord bot that you can use for adding, reading and deleting your wishes.<br/>
It's written in python using the discord.py API wrapper for discord bots.<br/>
It stores its data in a SQL database using sqlaclhemy library in python.<br/>
## How to use it?
You will need to host the bot yourself. I will probably make a .exe file for running the bot, but for now<br/>
you will need to setup a few things before using it.<br/>
1. Download the python interpeter from python.org<br/>
2. Make sure to add PATH in the installer (If you don't do this you can do it manually, there are probably some tutorials on youtube on how to do it).<br/>
3. Press Win+R and type CMD and open it<br/>
4. run this command without the double quotes - "pip install discord sqlalchemy"<br/>
5. Run the models.py to create the database<br/>
6. In the token.txt paste your secret token<br/>
7. Run main.py to start the bot<br/>
## What's next?
I will probably add a feature for editing contents and title of a certain wish<br/>
and maybe some minor bug fixes, but I will probably be abandoning the project,<br/>
and it will not have any support at all.<br/>
